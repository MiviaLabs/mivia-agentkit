# Agent Report Template v1

Use this exact shape for audit, coverage, review, delivery, and handoff reports. Do not add sections unless the user explicitly asks for a longer artifact.

Result enum is exactly `PASS`, `BLOCK`, `PARTIAL`, or `NOT_RUN`.
Keep every cell to one short sentence or `none`.

```md
ReportFormat: mivia-agent-report/v1
Skill: <name>
Result: PASS|BLOCK|PARTIAL|NOT_RUN
Scope: <exact files/packages>
Baseline: <branch/commit/diff>
Summary: <one sentence>

| ID | Severity | Status | File:Line | Finding | Required Fix | Required Test | Mutation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| none | none | closed | none | none | none | none | none |

| Command | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| none | NOT_RUN | none |

ResidualRisk: none|<short exact risk>
NextAction: none|<exact task>
```

## Field Rules

- Severity never gates approval; every open gap must be fixed.
- `PASS` requires zero gap rows and `ResidualRisk: none`.
- Gap statuses are `open`, `missing`, `shallow`, and `gated`.
- Low-severity gaps still require `BLOCK` or `PARTIAL` until fixed.
- `Result: PASS` only when all required checks ran, no finding row has a gap status, and no residual risk remains.
- `Result: BLOCK` when any correctness, security, coverage, or verification gap can be fixed before merge or handoff.
- `Result: PARTIAL` when useful work completed but a named blocker, gated dependency, or user decision remains.
- `Result: NOT_RUN` only for a pure planning response or when verification could not start.
- `Severity` values are `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`, `info`, or `none`.
- `Status` values are `open`, `fixed`, `closed`, `missing`, `shallow`, `gated`, or `none`.
- `File:Line` must be an exact repo path with line number when possible, or `none`.
- `Required Test` must name the exact test file and test name for open gaps, or `none`.
- `Mutation` must name the guard or branch that should fail when changed, or `none`.
